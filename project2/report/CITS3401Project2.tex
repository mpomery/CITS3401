\section*{Introduction}
\paragraph \indent
The project specified that we are to develop several classifiers for wines using different classification methods to compare how machine learning performs compared to experts when rating different wines.
The initial data is split into two groups, red wine and white wine, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository\cite{datasetlocation}.
Data analysis was done using Weka\cite{weka}, data mining software created by Machine Learning Group at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.
Specifically, we are using the classification and clustering tools in Weka Explorer for analysis.

\section*{Data Preprocessing}
\paragraph \indent
The initial data provided was in two files, \texttt{winequality-red.csv} and \texttt{winequality\-white.csv}, that where converted to Weka's ARFF file format using an online conversion tool\cite{csv2arff}.
This tool was used to output two datasets, dataset 1 (\texttt{ds1-red.arff} and \texttt{ds1-white.arff}) and dataset 2 (\texttt{ds2-red.arff} and \texttt{ds2-white.arff}).
Dataset 1 contains all the information that was in the original data, and is used to create the classifier.
The fields in this dataset are numeric, apart from the quality which is nominal, making it is possible to group wines that receive the same rankings in Weka.
Dataset 2 is contains all the numerical information from the original data and does not contain any information about the rankings from the wine tasters.
The aim is to cluster these so that the wines fall into groups similar to the quality attribute of dataset 1.

\section*{Clustering}
\paragraph \indent
Dataset 2 requires clustering before it can be classified as the quality attribute of each data point has been removed.
Simple K means clustering was used and after experimenting, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and density were ignored for the red wine data.
This gave a roughly similar distrubution to the qualities found in the red wine dataset.
In the white wine dataset, ignoring the different attributes has very little effect on the clustering.
After ignoring different combinations of attributes, it does not seem possible to cluster the data points into a similar distrubution to the initial data.
Comparing the clustering with the red wines quality information shows a 35\% accuracy in the groupings, while for the clustered white wines there is only 25\% accuracy.

\section*{Classification}

\subsection*{Naive Bayesian}
\paragraph \indent
Naive Bayes classifiers are simple to implement, fast, and are used in real world situations such as spam filters.
They work by looking at the traits of an object, and using each individual trait to determine how likely it is that the object falls into a specific classification.
Their downside is that they assume the presence or absence of particular traits has no affect on the classification.
We used cross-validation for Naive Bayes with 10 folds in Weka to calculate classfify all the wines, and compared the classifications with the quality fields.
Experimentation showed that increasing the number of folds for the red wine only had minimal effect on the accuracy of the classification.

\subsection*{Support Vector Machine}
\paragraph \indent
Support Vector Machine's are learning models and algorithms that analyze data and find patterns, then use the patterns for classification of data.
Unlike the Naive Bayesian classifier, the support vector machine is a non-probabilistic classifier, meaning that it will not provide uncertainty for the results.
This means that each different category is separated by as large a gap as possible.

\subsection*{Neural Network}
\paragraph \indent
Neural Networks are based off of animal's central nervous systems, by using several input sensors that transform the data before handing it on to another neuron.
The neurons are connected together in a network and work simultaneously , rather then sequentially, to process the data.
Real world applications for neural networks include speech and handwriting recognition.

\section*{Results}
\paragraph \indent
The project stated that dataset 1, the unmodified dataset, and dataset 2, the clustered dataset, were to be compared through the use of classifiers.
Dataset 2 had it's classification clusters generated algorithmically from scientific data, while dataset 1's classifications where assigned depending each wines sensory information.
For this reason we could assume that the classifications in dataset two will be easier to classify, as they are based off of objective data rather than subjective.

\paragraph \indent
The white wine data falls into a bell curve shape, while the majority of red wine classifications fall into two distinct bins.
This makes classification hard as the majority of our data is 
This difference can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:redwinedist} and Figure \ref{fig:whitewinedist}.


\paragraph \indent
The information supplied about each wine is incomplete, as it is missing attributes such as grape type, brand and cost that can effect a testers perception\cite{brandloyalty}.
Wines that sell at a higher price may be percieved as better wines, even though they contain the same physiochemical properties as a cheaper wine.
The range of wines are limited to varients of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine and the classification of the wines is subjective.
This means that for someone tasting a wine from a different region may see the same physiochemical properties, but classify the wine completely differently.
